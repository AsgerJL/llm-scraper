# **Job Crawler using `crawl4ai`**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a web scraping pipeline that extracts job listings and contact details from **IT Job Bank** using `crawl4ai`. It consists of two main scripts:  

1. **`crawl.py`** – Scrapes job listings and saves them in `scraped-data/job_urls.json`.  
2. **`crawl-llm.py`** – Extracts contact information from job ads using an LLM (GPT-4o-mini) and saves results in `scraped-data/job_contacts.csv`.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Automated job listing extraction** – Scrapes job details like title, company, and location.  
✅ **Pagination handling** – Crawls multiple pages dynamically.  
✅ **Contact information extraction** – Uses `crawl4ai` and GPT-4o-mini to extract recruiter details.  
✅ **CSV output** – Saves extracted job contacts in a structured format.  

## **Setup & Installation**  
### **1. Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

### **2. Install dependencies (Recommended: `uv`)**  
I **highly recommend using `uv`** for package management due to its speed and efficiency.  
To install dependencies, run:  
   ```sh
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
Alternatively, you can use `pip`:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

### **3. Set up environment variables**  
Create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:  
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## **Usage**  
I also use `uv` to run the scripts for faster execution:  

1. **Run the job crawler to collect job listings**  
   ```sh
   uv python crawl.py
   ```
2. **Extract contact details from job ads**  
   ```sh
   uv python crawl-llm.py
   ```


## **Output Files**  
- `scraped-data/job_urls.json` – Stores scraped job listings.  
- `scraped-data/job_contacts.csv` – Stores extracted recruiter contact details.  

## **Dependencies**  
- `crawl4ai` (Web crawling and LLM-based extraction)  
- `pydantic` (Data validation)  
- `python-dotenv` (Environment variable management)  
- `asyncio` (Asynchronous execution)  

## **Future Enhancements**  
🔹 Improve error handling and retry mechanisms.  
🔹 Add more job boards for broader coverage.  
🔹 Implement a UI or API for querying job contacts.
